Welcome!

This is a game to teach some basic Linux based commands in a bash type emulation or terminal.

To start playing, open your terminal.

Type the letters "cd" (without the quotes) into the terminal.

Press the spacebar.

Then drag and drop the "start_adventure" directory from this folder into your terminal.

If your terminal asks you what you want to do with what you have dragged into it, select "Paste location".
If it doesn't ask, assume that it pasted the file path of the folder you just dragged into it.

If all else fails type in the path name.

Example (don't type the $, $ just means command):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd /home/your_username/Downloads/BlarfenBlargen_LARK_Project/start_adventure
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

or simply,

----------------------------------------------------------
$ cd Downloads/BlarfenBlargen_LARK_Project/start_adventure
----------------------------------------------------------

The command above should be in your terminal window, then press RETURN to enter the commmand.

The exact path to the start_adventure varies, depending on where you saved the file.

Your first move is very important and something you may have to do quite often.
Type this into the command line:

-----------
cat journal
-----------

You are now playing the game!
Good Luck!
